Started delighting the =Merchant of Venice= story.

It's really a fact that we suddenly became so utilitarist that our
style of speaking, writting and, really, expressing ourselves hears as
a technical writting.

Not rarely, /Classical/ pieces will make reference to Greek mythology
et al. Just like *Solarino* makes a reference to Janus, the two faced
god. Or when he mentions *Nestor* a historical figure depicted by
Homero. Currently, there are no cultural references in our vocabulary
to express being human. Our language has declined culturely, in
quantity and quality of interconnection of ideas and symbols.
